# Round Transition Bug Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When completing a round in the poker game, the round transition animation was not working correctly. After clicking "Continue" on the scoring screen, the game would show an error in the console and fail to transition to the next round.

### Console Error
```
game.js:150  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'then')
    at PokerGame.continueGame (game.js:150:18)
    at HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous> (game.js:22:86)
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the animation queue system. The `queueAnimation` method in `animations.js` was not returning a Promise that could be chained with `.then()`. When the game tried to execute:

```javascript
window.gameAnimations.queueAnimation(() => 
    window.gameAnimations.animateRoundTransition(this.gameState.current_round)
).then(() => {
    // Continue to next round
});
```

It failed because `queueAnimation` didn't return anything, causing the `.then()` to be called on `undefined`.

## Fix Implementation
Modified the `queueAnimation` method in `animations.js` to properly return a Promise and ensure the animation completes before resolving:

```javascript
// Before: No Promise return
queueAnimation(animationFunction) {
    this.animationQueue.push(animationFunction);
    if (!this.isAnimating) {
        this.processQueue();
    }
}

// After: Returns a Promise that resolves when animation completes
queueAnimation(animationFunction) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        // Store the original function with its resolver
        const wrappedFunction = async () => {
            await animationFunction();
            resolve();
        };
        
        this.animationQueue.push(wrappedFunction);
        if (!this.isAnimating) {
            this.processQueue();
        }
    });
}
```

## Testing Verification
- Tested round completion with various hand combinations
- Verified the round transition animation displays correctly
- Confirmed the game state updates properly for the next round
- Checked that all game mechanics continue to function after the transition

## Impact
This fix ensures smooth gameplay progression through all three rounds of the game, allowing players to experience the complete game flow with proper animations between rounds.

## Lessons Learned
When implementing animation systems with asynchronous behavior:
1. Always ensure Promise chains are properly implemented
2. Return Promises from functions that will be used in `.then()` chains
3. Wrap callback functions in Promises when they need to be awaited
